## 🎯 About Me

I’m a second-year Game Development student focused on gameplay systems and game architecture.

Over the past two years, I’ve worked on projects ranging from low-level C++ games (SFML) to multiplayer gameplay systems in Unreal Engine 5.  
I’m particularly interested in AI systems, combat mechanics, and multiplayer logic.
